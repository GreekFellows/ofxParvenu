# ofxParvenu
An openFrameworks addon with nestable GUI.

## a few notes on installation
### the `fonts/` folder
ofxParvenu will attempt to load fonts from the `data/` folder in _your own project_.
Please copy-and-paste all contents in this `fonts/` folder into the `data/` folder for every project you wish to use ofxParvenu for.
For example, `fonts/Aileron-Black.otf` must go into `data/` and become `data/Aileron-Black.otf`.

## tutorial / example / documentation
Wait till I finish writing this addon.
